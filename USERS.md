# User Registry

## Active Users

| User ID | Name | Created | Notes |
|---------|------|---------|-------|
| (auto-generated) | | | |

## Default Account Structure

When a user is created, they automatically get:

| Account Type | Default Balance | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| checking | $1,000 | Daily transactions |
| savings | $500 | Long-term storage |
| treasure_chest | 0 gold bars | Game rewards |

## Gold Exchange Rate

- **1 Gold Bar = $7,000**

## User Flow

1. User opens Flutter app
2. Enter name on login screen
3. Backend calls `get_or_create_user` with name
4. User receives their accounts (or new ones created)
5. User ID stored locally for session

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/user/get-or-create` - Login/Register
- `GET /api/user/{user_id}` - Get user with accounts
- `GET /api/accounts/{user_id}` - Get all accounts

## Notes

- User IDs are UUIDs generated by backend
- Names don't need to be unique (ID is unique)
- Session persists until app restart (for hackathon simplicity)
